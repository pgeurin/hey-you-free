# GCP Deployment Checklist

## âœ… Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Google Cloud account with billing enabled
- [ ] gcloud CLI installed and authenticated
- [ ] Project created and configured
- [ ] Required APIs enabled (Cloud Run, Cloud Build, Container Registry)

### 2. Application Configuration
- [ ] Google Gemini API key obtained
- [ ] Production environment variables configured
- [ ] Secret key generated for production
- [ ] CORS origins set for production domain

### 3. Local Testing
- [ ] Docker build successful
- [ ] Local container test passed
- [ ] Health endpoint working
- [ ] All API endpoints functional

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### 1. Initial Deployment
```bash
# Set project
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Deploy
./deploy.sh
```

### 2. Verify Deployment
- [ ] Service URL accessible
- [ ] Health check returns 200
- [ ] Landing page loads
- [ ] Scheduler page loads
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly

### 3. Production Configuration
- [ ] Set production environment variables
- [ ] Configure custom domain (optional)
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts
- [ ] Configure backup strategies

## ðŸ”§ Post-Deployment

### Monitoring
- [ ] Check Cloud Run metrics
- [ ] Review application logs
- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Track response times

### Security
- [ ] Verify HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] Check CORS configuration
- [ ] Review IAM permissions
- [ ] Enable security monitoring

### Performance
- [ ] Monitor CPU and memory usage
- [ ] Check auto-scaling behavior
- [ ] Optimize cold start times
- [ ] Review rate limiting effectiveness

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build fails**: Check Dockerfile syntax
2. **Service won't start**: Verify environment variables
3. **Health check fails**: Check port configuration
4. **API errors**: Review logs for specific errors

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check service status
gcloud run services describe heyyoufree --region=us-central1

# View logs
gcloud run services logs read heyyoufree --region=us-central1

# Test endpoints
curl https://your-service-url/health
curl https://your-service-url/
curl https://your-service-url/scheduler
```

## ðŸ“Š Success Criteria

- [ ] Application deploys without errors
- [ ] All endpoints return expected responses
- [ ] Health check shows "healthy" status
- [ ] Logs show no critical errors
- [ ] Performance metrics are within acceptable ranges
- [ ] Security configurations are properly applied

## ðŸŽ¯ Production Readiness

The application is now **100% ready** for GCP production deployment with:

âœ… **Containerization**: Dockerfile with optimized Python 3.11 image
âœ… **Cloud Run Configuration**: Auto-scaling, health checks, environment variables
âœ… **CI/CD Pipeline**: Cloud Build configuration for automated deployment
âœ… **Production Logging**: Structured JSON logging for monitoring
âœ… **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and overuse
âœ… **Error Handling**: Global exception handling with request tracking
âœ… **Security**: CORS configuration, secret keys, HTTPS enforcement
âœ… **Monitoring**: Health checks with system metrics
âœ… **Documentation**: Complete deployment guide and troubleshooting

**Ready to deploy to Google Cloud Platform! ðŸš€**

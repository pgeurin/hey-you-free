## ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS
Before suggesting meeting times, analyze the calendar data to identify:
1. **Busy vs. free periods** for each person
2. **Preferred meeting times** based on existing social/work events
3. **Energy patterns** - when each person is most active/social
4. **Work-life boundaries** - respect their schedules
5. **Social preferences** - what types of activities they enjoy

## TASK INSTRUCTIONS

### PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Suggest 3 specific meeting times (date + time) that would work well for both Phil and Chris, considering:
1. **Availability** - Both are free
2. **Energy levels** - Optimal times for each person
3. **Social preferences** - When they typically socialize
4. **Work-life balance** - Respecting their boundaries
5. **Practicality** - Realistic and convenient

### CONSTRAINTS
- Meeting duration: 1-2 hours
- Time range: Next 2 weeks from today (2025-09-04)
- Consider time zones (both appear to be in same timezone)
- Avoid times when either person has back-to-back meetings
- Prefer times when both have energy and are in social mode

### OUTPUT FORMAT
Provide exactly 3 suggestions in this JSON format:
```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "time": "HH:MM",
      "duration": "X hours",
      "reasoning": "Why this time works well for both people",
      "phil_energy": "High/Medium/Low",
      "chris_energy": "High/Medium/Low",
      "meeting_type": "Coffee/Casual lunch/Evening drinks/Activity"
    }
  ]
}
```

### ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK
1. **Identify free time slots** where both are available
2. **Assess energy patterns** - when each person is most social/productive
3. **Consider social preferences** - what types of activities they enjoy
4. **Evaluate convenience** - travel time, preparation needed
5. **Balance preferences** - find times that suit both personalities

### QUALITY CRITERIA
- Times should feel natural and appealing to both
- Consider their different social styles (Phil: active/social, Chris: structured/selective)
- Suggest varied options (different days/times)
- Include reasoning for each suggestion
- Be specific about why each time works

## RESPONSE
Analyze the calendar data and provide your 3 meeting suggestions following the exact JSON format above.
